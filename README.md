MooTools-DatePicker
===================

Smoothly animating, very configurable and easy to install.
No Ajax, pure Javascript. 4 skins available out of the box.

This is a port of [MonkeyPhysics datepicker](http://www.monkeyphysics.com/mootools/script/2/datepicker) with cherry-picks
from http://github.com/arian/mootools-datepicker/

The idea of this fork is to keep the original spirit of the plugin where there were no extra dependencies and the cloned
element allowed the widget to play nice with the server.
